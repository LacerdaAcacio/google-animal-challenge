    This webapp has just one page, to check the currency exchange of brazilian real (BRL) against other currencies.
    The user types a currency code, and we show him the current exchange rate, with the option to check the exchange rate of the last 30 days.
    Some currency code examples:
        USD - US dollar
        EUR - Euro
        GBP - british pounds
        JPY - japanese yen
        CAD - canadian dollar
    Inside each day’s card, there’s a field called “close diff” - you should calculate the difference between this day's close rate and the previous day’s close rate.
    Once you finish your implementation, publish it into a git repository of your choice and share it with us. There is no need to host it running.
    Your application must run with npm start.
    Use React.JS 17+.
